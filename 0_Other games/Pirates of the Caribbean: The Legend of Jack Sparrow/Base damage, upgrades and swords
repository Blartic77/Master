Bomb		                        1 each (max I got was 15 hits but could go up to 20)
Axe		                        30
Will's/Elizabeth's special		13 each
Jack's fire blade (light)*		10
Jack's fire blade (heavy)*		10

*: damage to bosses since most normal enemies get their HP depleted instantly

Most of these were tested on Pequeno #1

Note that upgrading things like Light slash 2 only upgrades the 2nd slash, not both the 1st and the 2nd one

-Green swords (Formosa #2 aka Temple Terror): +25% damage to ALL forms of damage (from slashes to axes to throwing wooden barrels)
-White swords (Sand, sky, rum and gold): +50% damage to ALL forms of damage (from slashes to axes to throwing wooden barrels); if you picked the green swords 
it works as another +25% stacking damage bonus

Finally, note that most (if not all) ranged enemies have 10 HP whereas enemies with swords have HP values between 15 and 30 HP
