Ok, so here's what I could find so far:

-Mast:                  255
-Pequeno:               650
-Tang #1:               200
-Tang #2:               1000
-Pequeno 2:             1500
-Blacksmoke James:      1600
-Mallot #1:             500
-Koehler:               800
-Mallot #2:             1600
-Bo'sun:                1200
-Serpiente de Muerta*:  750
-Barbossa*:             2500
-Alberto Chaves (Blue): 600/600x3/180
-Benito Chaves (Red):   600x3/269
-Celio Chaves (Green):  389

Note that Jacoby and Pintel HPs are irrelevant since they can be defeated much more quickly by other means. 

*: like all enemies in "Return to Isla de Muerta", these take "50%" less damage (actually 33%); that is, all damage done to them is divided by 1.5.

Finally, note that for the Chaves brothers, a weird system was implemented since the devs didn't know which brother you'd go after. I'll explain it here:

___________

First fight
___________

Just lower Alberto's HP (600) to around 2/3 to make Benito come in. Alberto's HP is fully restored.

____________

Second fight
____________

Ok, here comes the weirdness. So each brother is given 600 HP, but the red bar seems to go down as if it was 1800 HP total. Each time a brother's HP would
be 0, it is given 600 HP again. Once you deal around 1400 HP, Celio comes in.

___________

Third fight
___________

If you thought the previous HP mechanic was weird get ready for something even weirder. Each brother starts now with a lower HP value and the total HP bar
displayed in red seems to display 1438 HP total. Simply deplete two of the brother's HPs to make them go down, although oddly enough they can stand on 1 HP
(you might notice the HP bar doesn't go down) and need extra hits to go down. Then, deplete the last brother's HP...and he'll be given another 600 HP, BUT
all damage you deal to this brother is now capped to 4 per hit. Yep, I said that right. Why? Honestly I have no idea. But since bombs deal little damage 
per hit but hit many times in a short amount of time, they can take care of this brother rather fast (simply compare how little his HP bar goes down to 
normal hits VS using bombs on him). So yep, weird mechanics to make these battles work, but I guess most of us didn't notice it during our first playthrough,
so...they kinda work as intended? Anyways, there goes my explanation.
