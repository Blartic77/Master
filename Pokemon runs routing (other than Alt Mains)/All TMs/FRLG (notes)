TM locations (in the order they are expected to be gotten):
-----------------------------------------------------------
-Get TM09 & TM46 in Mt. Moon
-Get TM43 & TM45 north of Cerulean
-Get TM28 in Cerulean

-Get Meowth army to get TM10 throughout the run (RNG-based)

-Get TM31 in S.S. Anne?
-Get TM44 in S.S.Anne (missable!)
-Get TM40 in Route 9
-Get TM27 in Route 12
-Get TM29 in Saffron
-Get TM12, TM21 & TM49 inside Rocket Hideout
-Get TM11, TM32 & TM47 in the Safari Zone
-Get TM18 in the Route 15
-Get TM48 in Route 12
-Get TM17 & TM25 in the Power Plant
-Get TM01, TM08 & TM41 in Silph Co.
-Get TM14 & TM22 inside the Pokemon Mansion
-Get TM02, TM07, TM37 & TM50 in Victory Road

-Whenever you get to Celadon for the last time, get to Celadon's Dept. Store, buy TMs 05 & 15 as well as TMs 28, 31 & 43 if used/not picked. Buy 1 Fresh Water, 
1 Soda Pop and 2 Lemonades, give 1 of each to the girl in the rooftop to get TMs 16, 20 & 33. Then get the Coin Case and TMs 13, 23, 24, 30 & 35 in the Game Corner

-After getting 60 Pokemon and obtaining the Rainbow Ticket, go to One Island -> Mt. Ember, get the password, go to Six Island -> Dotted Hole, get the password, and 
then go to Five Island -> Memorial Pillar, place the Lemonade to get TM42 and quickly get inside the Rocket Warehouse and simply get TM36

TMs from Gym leaders:
-TM39 from Brock
-TM03 from Misty
-TM34 from Lt. Surge
-TM19 from Erika
-TM06 from Koga
-TM04 from Sabrina
-TM38 from Blaine
-TM26 from Giovanni



Pokemon that would be useful for this kind of runs:
-Blastoise (no Water Pulse/Blizzard but could learn Brick Break and maybe Strength)
-Vaporeon (Medium Fast EXP curve and no Water Pulse so must get Surf quickly, but learns Bite and Aurora Beam by leveling up)
-Clefable/Wigglytuff (strong normal STAB and Brick Break but TM31 MUST be gotten in S.S.Anne for Rock Tunnel. No idea on how they get past Pokemon Tower though)
-Nidos
-Primeape? (can get Rock Slide in Rock Tunnel for coverage)
-Articuno? (Ice Beam + Fly)

Pokemon with issues for these runs:
-Psychic types without TMs are powerful but can have rather poor coverage (Kadabra, Mr. Mime, Jynx)
-Flying types with TM43 only to help them are likely limited as well
-Bug types, mainly Butterfree/Beedrill (duh, but having tried them in the past, trust me: they get WAY worse without TMs)
-Zapdos (no Electric type moves until Lv85 or re-learn Thunder Shock for the lulz)
