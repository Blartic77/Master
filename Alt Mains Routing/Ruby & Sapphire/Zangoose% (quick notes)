Very quick notes I took while testing the spread at 926f. 1458f seems to have a significantly lower chance of survival already by Maxie 1

Using candies around Winona seems like a good idea simply to prevent wild encounters from happening. You'll need to be at Lv31 for Mt. Pyre.
I also didn't fight any optional throughout the run

Note that this route could be optimized, specially the League segment

Stat stages for important fights (and the level when the battles started):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(-Learn Strength over Fury Cutter)

Rival 3: Lv24 => 2 Atk, 1 Spe
-Slash/Strength, Slash/Strength, Slash/Strength

Winona**: Lv25 => 6 Atk, 1 Spe

Phoebe: Lv44 => 4 Atk
-SB party (81% range on Sableye)

-Return spam

Steven*****: Lv49 => 6 Atk 2 Def
-BB x2 (+SB if Def boost from Steel Wing), SB, Return/SB, BB, BB, BB x2/SB x2


*: Cannot OHKO even at +6 Atk, so Slash Torkoal for a higher chance of crit (100% OHKO); if you die, revive Zangoose and set up on Torkoal after 3 OHs (-6 SpA) 
**: At +1 Spe you're NOT faster than Swellow so don't contest QA if at low HP
***: Lunatone has a 6% chance to OHKO Zangoose turn 1 and Solrock can 2 OHKO Zangoose with Psychic or any attack if in sun
****: Hyena has a 28% chance to 2HKO with Crunch
*****:Psychic takes up to 129 HP, so HEAL before Metagross


Candies used:
-4 candies on Mt. Pyre to prevent wild encounters (Lv27 -> 31)
-2 candies before TnL to get to Lv35 (Lv33 -> 35)
