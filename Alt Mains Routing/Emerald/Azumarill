These are my notes for the 2398f spread, using Pokefinder's frame count and method H2 (Lv5 F, Huge Power, Naughty, 18/19/6/10/10/12, HP Fight. 64 BP)

I ended up defeating Wattson with Azu's Rollout; however, this is unreliable and hard to achieve. I highly recommend either using Marshtomp OR a spread with more bulk
even if it requires a bit of training so that this is more reliable. Finally, know I might have over-relied on Rollout, and there might be faster ways of getting past
some battles (idk if taking Ice Beam is useful for it or not or if teaching it Surf is a good choice). This is a mon that requires more testing in order to figure out
the best way to speedrun it. Finally, you can check the times I got using LiveSplit with this spread and these strats here:

Notes:

------------
Pre-Roxanne:
------------
-Defeat the Youngster in Route 104 with Marill only.
-You MUST fight the Grunt with 1st Marill (TW x2), then switch to Mudkip and Tackle x3
-Defeat the creepy twins on Route's 104 bridge with Marill and Mudkip

-Once inside the Rustboro Gym, set the Battle Scene to Switch, give Orans to both Marill and Mudkip, and keep switching both so that pre-Roxanne Mudkip's Lv 11 and Marill's Lv10 (both have WG)
-It's better to make the 2nd battle a double. Marill should spam TW as Mudkip uses MS (Leppa if needed), then Tackle/DC + WG
-For the first Youngster: TW x3, switch to Mudkip, MS x4 (one with good Atk might 3 OHKO)

-Set the battle to Switch

________

Roxanne:
________

-If you've got crappy SpA IVs you won't OHKO the Geodudes with WG at Lv10 (not even after Potion). RT deals 15-18 HP and they can be faster once you're at -1 Spe
-Nosepass' Tackle deals 8 HP and RT around 20 HP at Lv11. WG deals 1/6 (might not 6 OHKO) to it at Lv11 with crappy SpA IVs
-Nosepass is faster even without Spe drops

-Simply switch Marill in and out for every mon of Roxanne (you'll need Marshtomp for Wattson anyway) so that you don't have to go through the pain of doing this fight with Marill

------------
Pre-Rival 2:
------------

-Defeat the hikers in Route 116
-Defeat the grunt
-Defeat Rival at Mr. Briney's house. Wingull can be 3 OHKO'd by Marill's Tackle and Treecko you can TW x2 -> Switch to Taillow/Abra (dies) -> Mudkip (RT x2)
-Defeat the Fisherman north of Dewford (spinner). Tackle 2 OHKOs (seems like a roll; equip Silk Scarf just in case)
-Defeat Tuber Chandler in Slateport's beach (Tackle 3 OHKOs his Tentacools without SScarf, might be a better idea to just give it Pechas). Also careful about confusion damage, it's rather high (+10 HP)

-Learn Rollout, ditch TW.

-Defeat the trainers in the SH. First the Tuber (DC + Rollout to sweep even at -6 Atk), then the Beauty and lastly the sailor (same process)

-Equip Oran Berry on Marill

-Defeat the grunts inside the museum (DC + Rollout, shouldn't get Bites or just 1 from Carvanhas). You should get Azu right afterwards
-Defeat the mandatory Pokefans in Route 110 (DC + Rollout, Tackle if Parahax for 1/4 damage)

-Heal para, heal HP if needed, equip Oran.

________

Rival 2:
________

-DC + Rollout and laugh at how ridiculous this fight is now. Just don't get Supersonic'd

------------
Pre-Wattson:
------------

-Defeat the other mandatory trainers in Route 110. WG x2 on Magnemite and Tackle on Abra (HP deals 3 damage lol)
-Defeat the fisherman north of the route. Tackle the Tentacools, DC + Rollout on the Wailmers
-Defeat Wally (Tackle to OHKO)
-Go to Rusturf Tunnel and defeat the Hiker's Geodudes with Mudkip. Defeat Machop with Azu (BS = Set)
-Equip Oran on Mudkip. Set BS to Shift. Go and defeat the Bug Maniac in Route 117 with Rock Tomb Mudkip (only 1 mon, otherwise it'll level up to Lv17 and won't learn Mud Shot). Rollout on Beautifly with Azu for OHKO
-Defeat only the mandatory Youngster in Mauville's Gym (you can Tackle his mons to 2/3 OHKO each)

________

Wattson:
________

Risky strat:
-Bait Rollout by showing Voltorb a Ground type like Geodude (you need him to hit you 5 times as you set up with 1 X Atk and 2 X Spes, Def Curl, then Rollout (must hit all times))

Safe strat:
-Switch to Marshtomp, then to fodder to see what move Voltorb used. If Rollout hit, Mud Shot x2, otherwise it either blew up or is about to
-It's good to have several fodder mons to heal Marshtomp in between kills (when needed)
-If you still have fodder when Manectric's about to come in, switch to fodder and heal Marshtomp to full HP

----------
Pre_Maxie:
----------

-Defeat the mandatory hiker on way to M.Falls

-Defeat the mandatory trainers. Double: DE Swellow + heal, DE Xatu (might or not OHKO apparently) + Rain Dance, Surf + heal, then for Pelipper DE, Rollout. DE x2 on Tropius (Razor Leaf takes about 40 HP, recoil is 35 HP; don't Rollout because it requires 3 hits to kill)

-Defeat the mandatory trainers in MD's Gym. Everything dies to DE

____________

Tate & Liza:
____________

-You need 2 X Spe to outspeed everything. With Mystic Water you need to be at +4 to OHKO everything (roll for Claydol) besides Xatu.
-Claydol's EQ deals around 45 HP, Xatu's Psychic around 60 HP at Lv42

-FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW THIS THING'S BROKEN AF:
-Use 2 X Spe, 1 X Acc., DC + Rollout on Xatu, Helping Hand on rollout turn 3 to OHKO Solrock, just keep reviving stuff and switching into flying types when Claydol uses EQ and boom! Done. EZ


------------
Pre-Maxie 3:
------------

-Defeat only the mandatory trainers inside the Space Center. You OHKO everything except the Lv32 Hyena with Surf

________

Maxie 3:
________

-You can just DF + Rollout targeting Maxie's mons and get this rather fast, since you're likely to get Swaggered.

_________

Archie 3:
_________

_____

Juan:
_____

-X Spe twice, X Atk twice, DC + Rollout, DE Kingdra (44% chance to OHKO at +2 with Silk Scarf, otherwise be at +3)

Wally:

-1 X Spe, 3 X Atk, 1 X Acc, DC + Rollout. You CANNOT MISS on Magneton or Roselia

-------
Pre-E4:
-------

-Defeat only the mandatory trainers.
-For CT Hope, DE OHKOs Roselia (mind the recoil, though)
-Save before the Trainer with the Swellow, he can make you lose a lot of time with Double Team. DE OHKOs it though, so you only need to hit once (35 HP recoil). Surf x2 on Mawile and DE Kadabra (30 HP recoil)
-For the 2nd female CT, Surf, DE (35 HP recoil + 50 sth if she Magical Leafs) + DE/Rollout (risky), Rollout/Surf x2
-For the 2nd male (lasto), DE (39 HP recoil), DC + Rollout (x2)

-If Shelgon attacks on the turn you use DC, it's likely going to Protect next turn. Use DC again

________

Wallace:
________

-Water Spout after its own Double-Edge recoil in rain deals around 95 HP (not even a 2 OHKO)
-Its DE deals over 60 HP
-The order in which he'll be sending out his mons is: Wailord/Ludicolo/Milotic/Tenta/Whiscash/Gyara.
-At +6 Atk and after DC Rollout sweeps as expected. Another Rollout OHKOs Gyara despite no DC and being only at +5
-Basically: use 1 X Spe, 6 X Atk, 1 X Acc., X Defs if needed to resist Wailord's DEs better, then DC + Rollout + Rollout to win.
-DON'T KILL WAILORD IF THE RAIN HASN'T STOPPED/WON'T STOP AFTER THE KILL. Otherwise Ludicolo (with Swift Swim) will switch in and a) hit you for good damage (possible kill) b) Double Team to annoy you (possible miss -> Rollout restart)
