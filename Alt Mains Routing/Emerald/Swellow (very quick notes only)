Pre-Roxanne:
------------
-Pick Mudkip as starter
-Get Taillow in Route 116 (it's at Lv8) as this skips doing the Route 104 twins. Get Abra as well to skip them completely
-Use Mudkip to help in Rustboro Gym (double battle only)

Winona:
_______

-OHKOs at +4 Atk at Lv32 with Return (90 BP) + Silk Scarf without Guts (2 OHKO on Skarmory)
-Calcs say HP Electric could, at best, only skip 1 turn on Pelipper, not saving any turns on Skarmory (but being slower due to having to raise both Atk and SpA if
the player wants to use HP Electric). Also doesn't seem to skip any turns on Gyarados swimmer

Champion (Wallace):

-Providing you kept a status condition (burn or poison) and assuming you're Lv55 with 140 Atk with the badge boost, have Facade and Silk Scarf, and assuming 
an order of Wailord/Tentacruel/Milotic/Ludicolo/Whiscash/Gyarados:
-Facade (88% range), Facade (Tentacruel), Facade (Milotic), Facade/Fly (Ludicolo; Aerial Ace is only a 50% range), Heal as Whiscash uses Hyper Beam + X Atk + Facade, Facade (Gyarados; 75% range)

Notes:

The issue is going to be Wally's Magneton 

Overall, it seems like HP Ground could be an option for the Flannery and Wally fights as Return would have about 79 BP only for the first fight and might need the
OHKO on the second one to prevent getting instantly KO'd by Thunderbolt (although something like HP Fighting could be a thing too, as there are 36 mandatory Dark
types and there's Petalburg Gym too, so it could save PP from Normal moves AND deal with Magneton, too)
