Quick notes for Exploud%. Frames macth Pokefinder's, method is H2. Probably can be optimized quite a bit, but here's what I gathered back in the day:

Jolly (Modest Shroomish):
-------------------------
1) Shroomish (748f):
-Lv6 Shroomish doesn't OHKO the first Hiker's Geodude with Absorb; use Bullet Seed (Aqua Pooch defeated by Mudkip)
-Lv11 Shroomish needs 3 BS hits to OHKO Roxanne's Geodudes. Seems to need 8 hits to defeat Nosepass
-For Roxanne's Nosepass, Leech Seed and Stun Spore can help to weaken it and outspeed it (Leech Seed might waste time, though, but can be learnt over Tackle)
 
2) Whismur (1103f):

In general, it seems like even the dumbest of trainers won't bother using Growl/Supersonic on you, which is bad because you'll get damaged a lot while setting up

-Uproar 2 OHKOs Youngster Billy's Shroomish even after Absorb, but seems like a range. At Lv13 it OHKOs Lotad (could be a range, too)
-At Lv13 Uproar 2 OHKOs Aqua Pooch 2
-At Lv13 it's risky to face Rival in Rustboro. Wingull dies to Uproar x2 but deals around 26 HP with 2 WAs. Treecko deals 9 HP with QA at Lv14
-At Lv13 Pound seems to be able to 2 OHKO Wingull (probably a range). Using Pound x2 on Treecko, 2 Potions/1 Super, then Uproar seems to get the job done
(Silk Scarf on for these battles):
-At Lv15 Howl once before using Uproar on Tuber Chandler
-At Lv16, check if Howl's needed to kill the Tuber's Azurill inside SH. Otherwise, simply Uproar x3
-At Lv16, Uproar x2 is a range on the Goldeen inside SH. You can Howl once since you're immune to Supersonic
-At Lv17, Uproar at +1 is a range on the Machop inside SH. Tentacool OUTSPEEDS you
-At Lv18, Uproar doesn't OHKO the Lv15 Carvanha. Bite deals around 20 HP. The Zubat can live Uproar at 1 HP (unboosted), you speed tie? and the Lv14 Carvanha does seem to die to Uproar
-At Lv18/19, Uproar OHKOs Pokefan Isabel's mons at +3. Only 178 EXP was needed after the battle to get Loudred.
-At Lv20, Uproar seems to OHKO Rival's 2 team at +2. Might need 1 X Spe if at Lv21 to outspeed Grovyle. Wingull deals around 10 HP with WG/WA and Grovyle does like 12 with Pursuit
-At Lv21, Howl once, then Uproar x2 on Athlete Alyssa's Magnemite
-At Lv21, you outspeed the Psychic's Abra and OHKO with Astonish. Same for Wally's Ralts at Lv22
-Have a Cheri on Loudred for Wattson 
-One strat that doesn't seem to work most of the time is to Howl turn 1 (Cheri MUST NOT be used), then switch to Mudkip to take the Self-Destruct
-Always use first 1 X Spe if Voltorb's alive. If Effect Spore poisoned it, you can kill it with Pound before it blows up
-At Lv22, Wattson's Voltorb deals +20 damage with Spark. Self Destruct deals 50-60 HP. Sometimes Voltorb blows up turn 1 even if you're at full HP (?). Electrike deals +20 HP with Shock Wave and around 7 HP with QA at first
-Wattson's Voltorb deals 14 HP to Shroomish (Lv12) with Spark. It seems to try to kill it with Spark spam 
-Using Guard Specs and 1 X Def isn't a bad idea to prevent Manectric from dealing an immense amount of damage with QA later. Rollout at +6 can fail to OHKO Electrike at Lv23 (irrelevant except for Static chance). You need +2 Spe to outspeed Manectric
-I ended up using 3 X Atks, 3 X Defs, 3 Guard Specs., 2 X Spes and 1 X Acc

-For the Route 114 mandatory Hiker, set Battle Style to Shift, switch to Shroomish and BS. You need 4 hits at Lv12 (you may also Absorb); Magnitude 7 took 15 HP. OHKO Numel with Uproar (can live)
(I took the PP Up before Route 116)
-For the Rusturf Hiker, keep switching between Loudred and Shroomish and OHKO Machop with Strength
-On way to Mauville switch battle style to Set
-Once in Mt Chimney remember that only the first Zubat dies to Uproar (not Rollout), all Numels require Strength to die
-For Maxie, +1 Atk is needed to 2 OHKO Hyena and Camerupt with Strength (might trigger heals), but you should outspeed everything
Take the meteorite
-For Flannery, switching out to Shroomish is recommended because, even if the AI doesn't use OH turn 1, it will turn 2 due to it being super-effective
--Numel's OH at -2 deals 38 HP in sun.
--Howl 4 times, Revive something if it's all dead and then Strength spam until Torkoal, then gamble (take 60-70% of its HP and die/live it OH miss).
--At -2, Torkoal's OH deals +70 HP in sun (45-55 HP otherwise). Body Slam deals around 35 HP
--If outside of killing range, Torkoal can use Sunny Day even without having any OH PP left
--You need to be at +3 to 2 OHKO Torkoal with Strength
-After whiting out in the desert (having taken the candy first) and showing up in Petalburg, get to Dewford and Strength spam on Brawly
--Learn Stomp over Uproar
-Teach it OH over Rollout 
-Inside PG take full right. Strength x2 on Delcatty (speed tie), OH x2 + Strength Slakoth, Strength/OH + Howl + Strength on Vigoroth
(I used the PP Up from before on Strength)
-Vigoroth deals around 35 HP with a single Slash at Lv29
-For Norman, he brings Slaking right after Spinda (?). At Lv30 Strength at +5 2 OHKOs Slaking for sure, so it might be a good idea to kill Spinda at +4, set up one more, then Strength spam to sweep. You only need 1 X Spe for this. At +1 Def Spinda deals like 20 HP with both Psybeam and Facade, and Slaking's Facade deals around 55 HP (35-45 at +2 Def) 
-Afterwards, taking the candy in Petalburg and the one in Route 110, then defeat the trainers in Route 118
-Inside the Weather Institute, Stomp Carvanhas, Zubats and Pooches. For Shelly's Hyena switch out to Mudkip (dies to Bite), then Stomp + Strength
-For Rival 3: Stomp Slugma at Lv33, X Spe on Lombre's Fake Out, Howl, Strength x2
--Grovyle deals +40 HP with LB
--Grovyle might die to OH at Lv33 without rain
-When using Repel teach SW to Castform, take the HP in Fortree, get the Revive, talk to Steven, get back to Fortree Gym
--Strength Doduo, SW Swellow. Strength Swellow, SW Pelipper. Strength Xatu, SW Pelipper. Finish off Xatu
--OH + Stomp/Strength Tropius
-At Lv34/35, +4 Atk/+1 SpA/+1 Spe to sweep everything with Strength/OH (can Stomp Swablu and Pelipper)
-Get out and head to Lilycove, then to Mt Pyre. Grab the Max Potion on the way
-Stomp the first 2 grunts. Double: Stomp Pooch, SW Wailmer, Stomp Carvanha, SW Wailmer, Stomp + SW, Stomp
-Get the Rare Candy and Fly to Fallarbor, buy X Atks, get Return, Fly to Lavaridge, get to the Magma Hideout
-Inside Stomp everything until Tabitha
-Tabitha: Stomp, switch to fodder (Mudkip dies to Bite), Stomp x2, Stomp, Strength x2
-Before Maxie 2, use 3 rare candies to get Exploud to Lv41, learn Hyper Beam over OH and teach it Return over Stomp
-Maxie 2: Guard Spec., X Spe, Howl x2 (risks ranges at +1), Return x3. Camerupt deals around 60 HP with EQ
-Get the Escape Rope, Fly to Slateport, scare off Archie, Fly to Lilycove, take the PP Up (use it on Return) and get inside the Aqua hideout
-Strength all grunts until you run out of PP, then Return
-Before Matt change battle style to Shift
-Matt: Hyper Beam Hyena (75% OHKO), switch to low level fodder (Shroomish is preferred), Hyper Beam
-Get out and Return x2 on the swimmer's Gyarados
-Once in Mossdeep heal at the PC and buy in the shop
-Strength everything inside the Gym. Before TnL, teach it HP Steel over Howl
-Careful: if around 1/3 HP, TnL will double on Exploud with Psychic + EQ even if your weakling is Flying type
-Be at Lv43 for TnL, at +3 with Silk Scarf Return OHKOs Claydol and Xatu and HP Steel OHKOs Solrock/Lunatone
-Claydol's EQ takes around 45 HP at Lv42
-For TnL start with birb for as many turns as you can while Claydol's alive to avoid EQs on Exploud (and heals) if possible
-My fight:
--X Atk
--X Atk
--X Atk
--Heal Exploud to full, Return on Xatu (Shroomish died pre-EXP, got to Lv43)
--HP on Lunatone
--Return on Claydol
--HP on Solrock

Note: if low on HP (around 50 HP left), kill Claydol first, since Solrock is weaker and has a lower chance of getting the KO on you

-Get to the Space Center. Don't bother using HP Steel because most mons live it (unless it's to finish off stuff). For the gatekeeper: Strength, Return (range), Return
--Strength weaklings. Hyper Beam the Lv32 Hyena

-Need to do more "research" into Maxie 3

-Get out and into Steven's house, get Dive, teach it to Mudkip when using a Repel, get to Archie's floor and get EQ (teach it to Exploud over HP Steel)
-Archie: Guard Spec. Needs 2 Atk and 1 Spe to sweep (Return x2, Strength)
-Get to Sootopolis, to Mossdeep, to Sky Pillar, and back to Sootopolis. Teach Waterfall to Mudkip and get into the Gym
-I defeated Juan at +4 Atk at Lv46. Kingdra's faster, though, so you'll need an X Spe
-Get to Mossdeep and go to EGC, get into VR
-Wally: I defeated him at Lv47 at +1: Return on Altaria/Gardevoir, Strength on Delcatty/Roselia, EQ on Magneton, 
-CTs: Strength Roselia; HB Claydol; Strength + Return Sandlash, EQ Ninetales, HB Tropius; Return Cacturne, HB Pelipper
-Do all restoration/shops needed. Have at least 1 fodder mon alive and place it 1st to absorb Hyena's Intimidate
(I used 1 Elixir and 1 Hyper)

-Sidney: Guard Spec., use 2 X Atks, Strength everything except Crawdaunt (Return)
Equip Soft Sand (if not, use 1 extra X Atk)
-Phoebe: Use 5 X Atks, Strength into the protect, EQ everything
Equip Silk Scarf
-Glacia: Use 2 X Atks, Return the first 4 mons (94% OHKO for 2nd Sealeo at Lv52), HB Walrein. Walrein deals +80 HP with IB/Surf
-Drake: Guard Spec, X Spe, use 3 X Atks. Return the first 4 mons, HB Salamence

-Wallace: Return, use 4 X Atks, Return/Strength, Return/EQ/Strength, Return/Strength x2, Return, Return/Strength/HB

Blizzards deals around 65 HP at Lv57. Water Spout at around 50% HP in rain deals around 100 HP
