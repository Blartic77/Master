Spread tested was 2283f in Pokefinder (H1, Male, Adamant, 27/25/29/11/28/31, HP Steel 45 BP)

Hidden Power is pretty much useless for this mon, and the only type I think that could make a somewhat significative difference without losing time would be HP 
Fighting. Also, Guts is pretty much useless for a good portion of the run because Swellow OHKOs regardless of Atk boosts, and yet, it's incredibly needed for the 
end-game. Easy mon to run and a fast one as well, I'm thinking this should be the Alt Main for rookies and people who want to try Alt Mains
