Spread tested was 2283f in Pokefinder (H1, Male, Adamant, 27/25/29/11/28/31, HP Steel 45 BP)

Hidden Power is pretty much useless for this mon, and the only type I think that could make a somewhat significative difference without losing time would be HP 
Fighting. Also, Guts is pretty much useless for a good portion of the run because Swellow OHKOs regardless of Atk boosts, and yet, it's incredibly needed for the 
end-game. Easy mon to run and a fast one as well, I'm thinking this should be the Alt Main for rookies and people who want to try Alt Mains

I picked the girl but you should pick the BOY so that Rival 3 has Lombre instead of an annoying Pelipper

I'm not claiming this is the fastest route for Swellow%/Taillow+. I'm simply doing a recap of what I did.
Additionally, you can find more specific details about the run at the end of the document. Also, I went Abraful for this one



------------
Pre-Roxanne:
------------
-Pick Mudkip as starter
-Get HM01 (Cut)
-Get Taillow in Route 116 (it's at Lv8) as this skips doing the Route 104 twins. Get Abra as well to skip them completely
-Use Mudkip to help in Rustboro Gym (fight the double only)

-----------
Pre-Brawly:
-----------
-After you're done delivering the Letter fight the spinner in Route 106 but DO NOT Wing Attack (OHKO). You want to get Poisoned here

_______

Brawly:
_______

-At Lv14 with Poison -> Guts and full HP:
--Turn 1: X Atk, receive max damage from Karate Chop (25 HP), lose 4 HP to Poison -> 9 HP left
--Turn 2: Wing Attack (OHKO), lose 4 HP to Poison -> 5 HP left
--Turn 3: Wing Attack (OHKO), lose 4 HP to Poison -> 1 HP left
--Turn 4: Wing Attack (OHKO)

Alternatively:
--Turn 1: X Atk, Machop goes for Bulk Up, lose 4 HP to Poison -> 34 HP left
--Turn 2: Wing Attack (doesn't get in healing range), goes for Bulk Up again, lose 4 HP to Poison -> 30 HP left
--Turn 3: Wing Attack (KO), lose 4 HP to Poison -> 26 HP left
--Turn 4: Wing Attack (OHKO), lose 4 HP to Poison -> 22 HP left
--Turn 5: Wing Attack (OHKO)

------------

_________

Flannery:
