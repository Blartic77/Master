People have asked me about this quite a few times so I decided to do this. Since people kept using Exarion's pastebin as a reference I've decided to make a list of 
what I think are the top 10 fastest Alt Mains for Emerald speedruns. Note these DON'T take Rayquaza into account - so estimations are given for runs that use it

This are the first 6 ones, which have splits with times to help guessing probable times a pro could get with them:

1) Swampert (2:45:XX)
2) Sceptile (2:53:35)
3) Blaziken** (2:59:XX)
4) Kadabra* (3:04:XX)
5) Azumarill* (3:07:XX)
6) Breloom* (3:10:XX)

*: runs were done by a noob who can beat his times by 10-15 minutes with some routing, so the times listed in here were cut by 20 mins. (could be cut by 25 mins. or more
maybe, but I didn't want to overestimate the time gap), thinking of a really skilled player with both very good RNG and execution. The times gotten can be checked here:

**: I really want to believe sub 3 with Blaziken is possible without Rayquaza with amazing RNG, although 3:05:XX is probably a better estimation

The next ones are probably:

7) Hariyama* (3:10:XX)
8 & 9) Delcatty** & Linoone* (between 3:10:XX and 3:15:XX)
10) Swellow*** (3:20:XX?)

*: Referencing the noob's times of 2:48:XX gotten for Makit and 3:01:XX for Linoone in Sapphire, and given he usually gets a 30 min. difference in his R/S and Emerald
runs, is how the estimations were made
**: unfinished run with a predicted pace of 3:36:XX for a scout run according to LiveSplit, have to see how good/bad late game is
***: the are several reasons Swellow is considered for this list. First, it's an Alt Main that can be gotten in the best possible place: Route 116. This is because
it can be gotten without fighting the Route 104 twins, at Lv8 (the highest possible before Roxanne), it's in the Medium Slow EXP curve which makes it level up
quickly and it has Guts as an ability to pair with an ok STAB in Normal type. However, it's put 10th due to expected issues throughout the run (not being able to
deal with Roxanne and Wattson on its own, being crippled by Intimidate, decent bulk only, Glacia, etc.), although this estimation could be wrong for better or
for worse
