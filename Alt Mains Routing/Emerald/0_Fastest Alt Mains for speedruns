People have asked me about this quite a few times so I decided to do this. Since people kept using Exarion's pastebin as a reference I've decided to make a list of 
what I think are the top 10 fastest Alt Mains for Emerald speedruns. Note these DON'T take Rayquaza into account - so estimations are given for runs that use it

This are the first 6 ones, which have splits with times to help guessing probable times a pro could get with them:

1) Swampert (between 2:45:XX and 2:50:XX)
2) Sceptile (2:53:35, can probably get sub 2:50:XX)
3) Blaziken** (2:59:XX)
4) Kadabra* (3:04:XX)
5) Azumarill* (3:07:XX)
6-7) Breloom* & Swellow* (3:10:XX)

*: runs with little to no routing were done by a noob who can beat his times by 10-15 minutes with some routing, so the times listed in here were cut by 20 mins. 
(could be cut by 25 mins. or more maybe, but I didn't want to overestimate the time gap), thinking of a really skilled player with both very good RNG and execution. 
The times gotten can be checked here:

Also, Azumarill can be run with significantly different styles so it's hard to figure out which one's the fastest one yet (using Ice Beam definitely makes several fights
faster, teaching it Surf or not doing so also changes how easy/hard some late game fights are, choosing Atk or Spe is significative for Wattson fight, etc.)

**: I really want to believe sub 3 with Blaziken is possible without Rayquaza with amazing RNG, although 3:05:XX is probably a better estimation

The next ones are probably:

8, 9 & 10) Hariyama*, Delcatty** & Linoone* (between 3:10:XX and 3:15:XX)

*: Referencing the noob's times of 2:48:XX gotten for Makit and 3:01:XX for Linoone in Sapphire, and given he usually gets a 30 min. difference in his R/S and Emerald
runs, estimations were made by adding 30 mins and then substracting 20 from the ideal pro plays (added about 10 mins to Hariyama due to no trade EXP boost)
**: unfinished run with a predicted pace of 3:36:XX for a scout run according to LiveSplit, have to see how good/bad late game is
