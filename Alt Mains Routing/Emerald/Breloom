I used the Lonely Sync -> 3888f (Lv5 F, Lonely, 10/24/11/19/2/31, HP Ghost 68 BP) spread for this. I went Abraless. I might expand upon this but here are
some notes on Breloom% for Emerald. Here are the split times I got while doing this:
https://github.com/NextLevelMemes/Master/blob/master/Alt%20Main%20Splits/Emerald%20Alt%20Main%20splits

PICK THE BOI OR ELSE

------------
Pre-Roxanne:
------------

-Pick Torchic so that Rival 2 doesn't have Wingull, Slugma and Fury Cutter Grovyle
-Get the Lonely Sync Ralts in Route 102
-Get a Marill in Route 104
-Get a Lv6 Taillow in PWoods
-Defeat the creepy twins with Taillow and Shroomish
-Take HM01 and teach it to Torchic
-At Lv7 you outspeed all Geodudes in Rustboro Gym
-Defeat all trainers in Rustboro Gym with BS spam. Once at Lv10 you can Absorb the Hiker's Geodudes if you need HP


________

Roxanne:
________

-Absorb + BS the Geodudes to make Roxanne waste her Potions on them
-Learn Leech Seed over Stun Spore
-At Lv13 you outspeed the 2nd Geodude even at -1 Spe (speed tie at -2 Spe)
-Nosepass takes like 10 BS hits to KO with the Oran Berry
-Nosepass' Tackle deals around 8 HP and RT about 17 HP


------------
Pre-Rival 2:
------------

-Defeat the hikers in Route 116
-Defeat the grunt
-So as you may know I'm nuts and defeated Rustboro Rival (YES I MEAN THE TORKOAL FIGHT BECAUSE I'M AN EXP WHORE)
--Torkoal doesn't seem to like to Ember Shroom (?). So Leech Seed it while it uses Curse
--Ember deals around 23 HP so it doesn't 2 OHKO after Leech Seed (you get 5 HP back)
--You can switch out but DON'T bring Torchic or Marill, it takes ages for it to defeat them (specially a Thick Fat Marill if you spam DC)
--Learn Mega Drain over Absorb, MD x2
-Take Miracle Seed and X Attack on your way back and equip the MSeed
-Defeat the spinner in Route 106 with Tackle x2 (range, if you miss it, BS)
-Get the Stardust in Route 106
-Once in Route 109 take the Revive and defeat only the Beauty inside the Seashore House (Tentacools are very annoying for Shroom)
-Defeat the Pokefans as singles with Shroom only
-Equip the Silk Scarf and SAVE before Rival 2

________

Rival 2:
________


-X Atk x2, Tackle x3 Lombre (heal to full before finishing it off), Tackle x2 Slugma, Mega Drain + Mega Drain/BS Marshtomp
-Lombre deals up to 15 HP with Swift and Slugma up to 26 HP with Ember. Marshtomp deals up to 12 HP with Mud Shot and 10 HP with Torrent WG
-Marshtomp is faster even at Lv21

------------
Pre-Wattson:
------------

-Equipping MSeed might be a good idea for the Magnemite
-Defeat the mandatory trainers as singles (MD x3 + BS Magnemite, Tackle x2 Abra)
-Learn Headbutt over Tackle
-Equip the Silk Scarf if you don't have it equipped
-Defeat the fisherman (Headbutt Tentas, MD + BS Wailmers), get Breloom. Learn Mach Punch over Leech Seed
-Defeat Wally with Headbutt
-Defeat the Bug Maniac (Headbutt (+BS), Headbutt) and Guitarist (Headbutt, MP)

------------------
Pre-Tate and Liza:
------------------

-Once you get to Lv39 inside Aqua Hideout use 9 Rare Candies to get to Lv48
-Before TnL: place your Flying type 2nd. Grab popcorn

____________

Tate & Liza:
____________

-HP Ghost Xatu, X Atk, HP Ghost Lunatone, HP Ghost Claydol + heal to full HP, HP Ghost Solrock

________

Maxie 3:
________ 

-Guard Spec., X Spe, X Atk x2, defeat Maxie first: MP, Return, Return. Afterwards Return, Return, MP
--Bad outcomes: 
1) Metang KOs Tabitha's mons and you get both Hyenas on the same turn after Guard Spec. expires, leaving you open to a possible Scary Face regardless of which one you KO 
2) Metang KOs Maxie's Hyena before you're done setting up, Maxie brings Crobat which can OHKO you but you can't OHKO -> Wing Attack KO (Maxie seems to randomly choose to bring Camerupt/Crobat next)

Also, Maxie can switch out Hyena and bring Camerupt after it's taken a Metal Claw attack, which means you'll have to deal with Intimidate later

In other words: Metang is a troll

_________

-Guard Spec. on fodder, X Atk, X Spe, MP, Return, MP

_____

Juan:

______

Drake:
______

-Guard Spec., X Atk x3, X Spe, Guard Spec., (X Atk,) Return x5
-You can use BB/SU on non-flying types to OHKO
-The setup shown above is long because you need to be at +3 Atk for Salamence. It naturally outspeeds and has a 50% chance to OHKO Breloom at Lv57 with Flamethrower
--However, Shelgon is really scared of Breloom and spams Protect very often, making this setup quicker
--If you feel like risking it and skipping X Atks/Guard Spec.s, be aware that Kingdra comes after Salamence (Intimidate) and requires 2 Atk boosts to be OHKO'd by BB/SU/Return

-Revive 5 fodder mons

________
