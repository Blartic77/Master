1) Keen Eye (also Intimidate?):

-It seems like the "prevention" effect might also be a Pokemon change for a given frame. However, more research is needed for this to be 100% confirmed. 
-The changed encounters so far include:

---------------
1.1. Route 116:
--------------- 
-Frame 876 becomes Abra instead of Nincada. 

---------------
1.2. Route 102:
---------------
-Frame 950 becomes Ralts instead of Pooch.
-Frame 1203 becomes Lotad instead of Wurmple.
-Frame 1521 becomes Ralts instead of Wurmple.

This could indicate that abilities that alter encounters can also alter the encounter frames for grass/cave/surf/fishing encounters.
