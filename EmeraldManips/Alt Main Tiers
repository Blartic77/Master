Criteria:
---------
S rank: no major struggles throughout the run
A rank: 1-2 major struggles, might have some extra struggles but these are rather minor and/or short. Outside of the major struggle(s) it doesn't really lose time 
        in other places
B rank: 2 or more major struggles. Some pokemon struggle through a rather long segment (10-30 mins) where viability is low and it's really hard to keep going
C rank: the pokemon really struggles to finish the run but overall has decent offensive and can one shot a decent amount of "normal" trainers. 
        It's not unusual for the mon to struggle for a very long segment (more than 30 mins); however, there are some segments where the offense is good
D rank: the pokemon struggles to one shot the majority of "normal" trainers, struggles to get past most of the important battles, offense doesn't really get good
        anywhere
