An autosplitter for TRA (Tomb Raider Anniversary), for both 100% and Any% no BJ (Bug Jumps) SS (Single Segment), using LiveSplit as a timer. Includes:

1) Load remover for RTA w/o loads.
2) 53-57 autosplits (100%) or 23 autosplits (Any% No BJ) for the entire story mode (Croft Manor not included in Any% No BJ).
3) Autoreset function upon dying. However, because there are different types of death in this game, pinning down their variables can be a difficult task. Includes death when HP is 0, when Lara falls into a bottomless pit or when she falls into lava. This is beta content, though, and other than HP-based deaths, these autoresets are rather unreliable. Because of this, they are not active by default.
4) An experimental "race" autoreset for challenging friends, which sadly does not seem to work with LiveSplit v1.7.7. 
   It is not active by default.

Remember that splits for both categories are available on speedrun.com

To use it, get the .asl (https://www.speedrun.com/tools/traNewest_80pl6.rar), run LiveSplit, right click on it --> Edit Layout --> + --> Control --> Scriptable Autosplitter, then
go to Layout Settings --> Scriptable Autosplitter and select the .asl file. As of now you should leave all 23 autosplits selected, 
as otherwise it might not work well.
