An autosplitter for TRA (Tomb Raider Anniversary), for any category, but primarily for both 100% and Any% no BJ (Bug Jumps) SS (Single Segment), using LiveSplit as autosplitter. Includes:

1) Load remover for RTA w/o loads.
2) 23 autosplits for NBJ instead of the typical 7. Originally, the last split included 3 levels which lasted around 7 minutes, which is almost 1/3 of the total time of NBJ speedruns. That didn't give speedrunners much information: this one splits that section in 6, allowing you to know which parts you should improve and which one syou can be satisfied with.
2) 53-57 autosplits for the entire story mode while running 100% (depending on whether you want to autosplit after each region or not).
3) Autoreset functions upon dying. However, because there are different types of deaths in this game, pinning down their variables can be a difficult task. Includes death when HP is 0, when Lara falls into a bottomless pit or when she falls into lava. This is beta content, though, and other than HP-based deaths, these autoresets are rather unreliable. Because of this, they are not active by default.
4) Autoresets based on IGT, which might be useful for races and practicing runs/individual levels. Might not work 100%, and I might improve it in the future.

Remember that the splits for both NBJ and 100% categories are available on speedrun.com

To use it, get the .asl (https://www.speedrun.com/tools/traNewest_80pl6.rar), run LiveSplit, right click on it --> Edit Layout --> + --> Control --> Scriptable Autosplitter, then go to Layout Settings --> Scriptable Autosplitter and select the .asl file. As of now you should leave all 23 autosplits selected.
