An autosplitter for TRA (Tomb Raider Anniversary), for any category, but primarily for both 100% and Any% no BJ (Bug Jumps) SS (Single Segment), using LiveSplit as autosplitter. Includes:

--------------------
ENABLED BY DEFAULT:
--------------------

1) Load remover for RTA w/o loads.
2) 23 autosplits for NBJ instead of the typical 7 . Originally, the last split included 3 levels which lasted around 7 minutes, which is almost 1/3 of the total time of NBJ speedruns (24-25 mins. on average). That didn't give speedrunners much information: this one splits that section in 6, allowing you to know which parts you should improve and which ones you might be satisfied with.

--------------------
DISABLED BY DEFAULT:
--------------------

3) 53-57 autosplits for the entire story mode while running 100% (depending on whether you want to autosplit after each region or not).
4) Autosplits based on level: each time you reach the end of a level, you'll get an autosplit (includes the last autosplit before the credits). Probably more useful for Glitchless and Bug Jump categories.
5) Autoreset functions upon dying. However, because there are different types of deaths in this game, pinning down their variables can be a difficult task. Includes death when HP is 0, when Lara falls into a bottomless pit or when she falls into lava. This is beta content, though, and other than HP-based deaths, these autoresets are not 100% reliable. They are not active by default.
6) Autoresets based on IGT, which might be useful for races and practicing runs/individual levels. 
7) Autoresets based on you cheating/hacking with external programs (yup, I've said that right). This is a very early version of it, but it could be of some use when a mod/admin asks for live verification of a run or while racing, so that both players might make sure the other one's not cheating/hacking.

Remember that the splits for both NBJ and 100% categories are available on speedrun.com.

To use it, get the .asl (https://www.speedrun.com/tools/NLM_TRAautosplitter_v3_80pl6.lss), run LiveSplit, right click on it --> Edit Layout --> + --> Control --> Scriptable Autosplitter, then go to Layout Settings --> Scriptable Autosplitter and select the .asl file. As of now you should have all 23 autosplits ticked and you should be good to go.

You can reach me via Discord if there's any trouble with it (username = NextLevelMemes).
