An autosplitter for TRA (Tomb Raider Anniversary), for any category, but primarily for Any% no BJ, using LiveSplit as autosplitter. Includes:

--------------------
ENABLED BY DEFAULT:
--------------------

1) Load remover for RTA w/o loads.
2) 23 autosplits for NBJ instead of the typical 7. Originally, the last split included 3 levels which lasted around 7 minutes, which is almost 1/3 of the total time of NBJ speedruns  at that time (24-25 mins. on average). That didn't give speedrunners much information: this one splits that section in 6, allowing you to know which parts you should improve and which ones you might be satisfied with.
3) Autoreset when loading your 0:00 save file.

--------------------
DISABLED BY DEFAULT:
--------------------

4) 54-57 autosplits for the entire story mode while running 100% (depending on whether you want to autosplit after each region or not).
5) Autosplits based on level: each time you reach the end of a level, you'll get an autosplit (includes the last autosplit before the credits). It also prevents unwanted splits while loading saves from different levels (like in 100% runs) and now has a split for Croft Manor.
6) Autosplits for the new Alt + F4 trick for all NBJ, Glitchless and BTG categories.
7) Autoreset functions upon dying, regardless of death (resets even in QTE deaths).
8) Autoresets based on you cheating/hacking with external programs (yup, I've said that right). This is a very early version of it, but it could be of some use when a mod/admin asks for live verification of a run or while racing, so that both players might make sure the other one's not cheating/hacking.
9) Autoreset when restarting the Croft Manor (for 100% runs).

Remember that the splits for both NBJ and 100% categories are available on speedrun.com.

-The splits for NBJ can be found in the following link: https://www.speedrun.com/splits/TRAAnyNoBJ_4bqa3.rar

-The splits for 100% can be found in the following link: https://www.speedrun.com/splits/TRASecretsSplits_fmme1.rar

To use them, get the .asl (https://www.speedrun.com/tools/NLM_TRAautosplitter_v3_80pl6.zip), run LiveSplit, right click on it --> Edit Layout --> + --> Control --> Scriptable Autosplitter, then go to Layout Settings --> Scriptable Autosplitter and select the .asl file. As of now you should have all 23 autosplits ticked, but if you're running a different category can also untick it and tick the 100% or level options, as well as the autoresets if you want to practice. Hit OK twice. Then right click on the timer --> Open Splits --> From File and select the proper .lss file (you'll have to extract it first). Notice that there are no splits for categories that depend on level yet since the Glitchless and Bug Jump categories don't trigger the same amount of endscreens (you'll have to make them yourself depending on your category).

Finally, if you need help with the autosplitter you can find detailed information on how it works here, as well as troubleshooting: https://www.speedrun.com/tra/guide/7dxat
